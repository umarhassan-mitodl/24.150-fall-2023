Write a paper using one of the following prompts. Your paper should be roughly 1500 words.

## Prompt 1

John Stuart Mill summarizes his case against restricting speech and opinion by writing “\[1\] We can never be sure that the opinion we are endeavouring to stifle is a false opinion; and \[2\] if we were sure, stifling it would be an evil still” (p. 88). What do you take to be Mill’s best argument for claim 1, and his best argument for claim 2? Think of an objection that could be raised against each of these arguments, and explain and present those objections in your paper. Do you think the objections are good? Why or why not?

## Prompt 2

Joshi argues that \[1\] “social pressure can degrade the epistemic commons” (p. 29) and thus that \[2\] we have a duty to speak our mind against social pressure. What kinds of social pressure does he have in mind, and what is his argument that their effect will worsen the epistemic commons? Why, on his view, do we have a duty to improve the epistemic commons? (You will want to explain what the epistemic commons is, and what makes it better or worse.) Think of an objection that could be raised against Joshi’s argument, and explain it in your paper. Do you think the objection works? Why or why not? (You may discuss more than one objection if you like.)

Your paper will be rewritten in response to comments. In reading it, we will be asking these questions:

- Is the paper well-written (no grammatical mistakes, no convoluted sentences, clear expression of ideas)? 
- Are philosophical ideas and arguments from the reading represented accurately? 
- Are good reasons given for the paper’s claims? 
- Does the paper show evidence that the student has thought through the topic?

As you know, all your writing must be your own; please refresh your memory of class policies by consulting the syllabus. MIT’s policies about academic integrity may be found here: {{% resource_link "adad43cd-108c-4e02-9bcf-9c16d6a09708" "Academic Integrity: A Handbook for Students" %}}.
