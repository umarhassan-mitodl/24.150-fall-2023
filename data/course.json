Students analyze a\u00a0variety of\u00a0contexts and communicative practices, including\u00a0new media technologies,\u00a0to\u00a0debate how \"speech\" can be described and when it should be appropriately regulated.\u00a0The course also considers current disputes over free speech on\u00a0college campuses.",
